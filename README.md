[Home Page](https://steambrew.app/) • [Discord](https://steambrew.app/discord) • [Documentation](https://docs.steambrew.app/)

A centralized repository that manages and curates all community and official plugins for [Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium).
This repository exists to provide a secure, version-controlled collection of plugins that are approved for use with Millennium.

## Submitting A Plugin[^1]

To submit a plugin, open a pull request that adds your repository as a submodule. From the root of this repository, run:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository plugins/your-plugin
```

This pins your plugin at a specific commit. Updates to your repository won't appear here until you open a pull request to advance the pointer — this is intentional, as all code changes are audited before reaching users.

## Updating Your Plugin[^2]

To update your plugin to a newer commit, pull from inside the submodule directory, then commit the pointer change in the parent repo:

```
git submodule update --remote plugins/your-plugin
git commit -m "chore: update your-plugin"
```

Then open a pull request with that commit.

To clone all plugins at their pinned commits after a fresh checkout, run `git submodule update --init`.
